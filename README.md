# IMDb using MERN Stack (Project 0)
A MERN-stack based IMDb replica application, with React as the front end, Express and Node.js as the backend and MongoDB as choice of database.

The application imports the sample mflix database from MongoDB, showing all the movies, along with their ratings, reviews and date etc.
Users can leave reviews on their favourite (or least favourite) movie, or check up reviews on any movie before watching a new show/ movie. 

The main purpose of this application is just to portray the power of MERN stack, RESTful APIs and how they can be utilised together to make powerful applications!
